<h1>Horton Barker Liner Notes</h1>

<article>


<p>Years ago, a narrow-gauge railway ran through the small town of Laurel Bloomery in the mountainous
northeast corner of Tennessee. The town is named, not for the blossoms of the Rhododendron (called "laurel" by the mountain people), as one might suppose,
but for the circular masses of wrought iron produced by the foundry located there. Nicknamed the "Pea Vine" railroad by the local residents, because of
its twisting, winding, twenty mile route, it served the foundry, the farms, and the logging industry which thrived on the heavily timbered surrounding
hills. One of the engines, a small, black, pot-bellied smoke-belcher, was known affectionately as "Old Huldy".</p>
 
<p>Horton Barker was born in Laurel Bloomery
in 1889, and he recalls hearing "Old Huldy" wheezing and puffing by on its daily run.  Recalls it so clearly that he has appropriated its name for his
favorite pipe.  Now, Horton has "about a bushel" of pipes and his favorite would seem to be the one currently in operation. "Hope you don't mind if I light
up 'Old Huldy', " he will say, digging into his pocket for the Prince Albert tobacco. "I've been smoking for fifty-five years, but I plan to quit before
it gets a real hold on me. " But Horton will never give up "Old Huldy". "I was going to quit smoking today, but I'm afraid to risk it. You see, a fellow
once told me that, if a man was to quit smoking on a particular day of the week, he'd take pneumonia for sure. Trouble is, I can't remember just which
day he said it was." Later, while knocking the ashes out against the heel of his hand: "There! I told you I was going to quit smoking today and that's
the tenth time I've done it. " There's no stopping him.  Horton Barker, sightless since childhood, the result of an accident, is filled with an irrepressible sense of humor. Even the cane he uses to help him find his way about is given a name and a personality. "I'll
just hitch 'Old Morgan' here on the doorknob while we eat." "Old Morgan" does considerably more than let Horton know when he's approaching a step or an
obstacle. He listens to the echo of the tapping metal tip and can surprise you with what it tells him. For instance, he told me when we were passing a
car parked fifteen feet or more to one side of our path. As a boy, he would jump off of a cliff into eighty feet of water and then swim back to the base
of the cliff, locating it by the echo of a clicking noise made with his tongue. Horton now makes his home with his sister and her husband in St. Clair's
Creek (pronounced "Sinkler's"), Virginia, a tiny community in Smyth County, not far from Chilhowie. It's gently rolling country; the green pastures and
the fields of yellowing tobacco broken occasionally-ly by clumps of uncleared forest. In the distance is Mt. Rogers, the highest point in Virginia at 5,720
feet, and, just south of that, White Top, where Annabell Buchanan and John Powell directed their famous Folk Festival during the early 1930's. It was here
that Horton met other great ballad Singers, such as Texas Gladden and "Sailor Dad" Hunt, and added more songs to the repertoire he had inherited from his
mother and developed in all night song-swapping sessions with other students at the two schools for the blind he attended in his youth.</p>
 
<p>Horton never knew
his father, a lumberman who "worked cutting timber up in West Virginia quite a bit." While the family lived in Tennessee, Horton went to school in Nashville.
Later, when his mother remarried and moved across the state line into Washington County, Virginia, he was transferred to the School for the Blind in Staunton.
There Horton would delight in concealing the fact of his total blindness from his fellow 
students. He used to lead other boys around in the town until, one day, he inadvertently let one of them run into a post. "Say," the fellow asked, rubbing
his bumped head, "just how much do you see?" "Oh, I see pretty well," chuckled Horton. "'Course I can't quite make out sunlight.</p>
<p>Horton was first
visited by a ballad hunter in about 1930. Not sure of the date, Horton does remember that his name was Wil')ston Wilkinson and that he didn't record anything,
but simply listed the songs Horton knew. Within the next few years, however, Horton was recorded by Annabell Buchanan at White Top and by Sarah Gertrude
Knott in Washington, D.C. In 1937, Alan Lomax recorded him for the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress. Things died down a bit after
that. The country went to war and the work of the Archive was severely curtailed. Anyway, Horton went home to St. Clair's Creek to sit quietly on the porch
and smoke "Old Huldy." Once in a while, his good friend, Richard Chase, a young folklorist he had met at White Top, would come by and visit. Occasionally,
they would pile into the car and go off to a Folk Festival at Boone, North Carolina, or Abingdon, Virginia.</p>
 
<p>Most of the time he just sat and smoked and teased
the boys walking by the house.  He tells of the time two boys came up the road with a nice string of fish. Horton's sister, who had been sitting on the
porch with him, commented on the fish and then went into the house. Horton waited until the boys were directly in front of him, then called out, "Say,
that's sure a nice bunch of fish you have there!" The boys, seeing Horton alone on the porch, were flabbergasted. As they went on up the road, Horton could
hear them whisper-ing back and forth - -"How'd he know we had these fish? You reckon he can see some?" "Naw! He didn't see 'em. He smelled 'em!").</p>
 
<p>Horton's
musical artistry is as keenly developed as his wit, as this record will prove. But Horton is no folksong purist, he doesn't
have to be, if he hears a song he likes, he sets out to learn it, simple as that. Some of his songs are really composites of different versions he has
heard at one time or another. "When I hear a version of a song I like better than the one I've known, well, I just sort of adopt it." Right now he is
anxious to learn the version of "Lord Thomas" he heard Mike Seeger sing at the University of Chicago Folk Festival in February, 1961. "I really like his
version better than mine," he commented, as we rerecord his own. Aside from the classic "Child Ballads" and the lyric folksongs he sings, his repertoire
is made up of what he calls "Southern Sentimental Songs or Plantation Songs", gospel songs, hymns, and curious bits of humorous flotsam he has acquired.
At least one of his songs (Sweet Mary) he learned from his singing teacher at the school in Staunton.</p>
<p> For four years, until his
health forced him to give it up a couple of years ago, Horton earned his living by travelling with a "bible lecturer" in North Carolina and Tennessee, singing
the old gospel songs and sharing the unpredictable returns of the collection plate. "Sometimes he would say things that would aggravate them, make them
mad, and then they'd put all their money into my plate and practically none in his. Of course, I always divided up with him later.</p>

<p>My several days with
Horton Barker were truly memorable ones. We drove together to Beech Creek, North Carolina, where we took advantage of Mr. and Mrs. W. Smith Harmon's generous
hospitality and large living room for the recording sessions. On the trip, Horton gave me directions --"Bear right at the top of this hill; Take a left
at the other end of this bridge. " "Off to our right, now, you should be able to see an old brick house. That's over a hundred years old." "Don't I smell
a cemetery on the right now?" (This followed by a string of humorous epitaphs) "That was a good bridge, wasn't it? The next one isn't so good, I'm afraid."
etc. To know Horton Barker, to stroll leisurely with him to the top of a hill while the sun chases away the early morning mist and warms your shoulder-bones,
and --most of all --to sit and listen to him sing' the old ballads in his high, clear voice, unencumbered by accompaniment, is to suddenly become aware
of what is meant by "Amazing Grace.</p>
