<p> In the "good old days", before everyone had a video camera in their pocket, capturing the sights and sounds of daily life was challenging.  We had an option of taking home movies, pictures without sound, or recording the sounds on a tape recorder, which resulted in sound without pictures.  It would be years before the two would be combined into the videos we have today. </p>
<p> In our family we had the benefit of both home movies and sound recordings.  My Uncle Marvin Heath had a movie camera and he took countless pictures of the events in our lives.  My Dad, Ernest Heath, enjoyed recording the sounds of our youth.  Both men were passionate about preserving the memories. </p>
