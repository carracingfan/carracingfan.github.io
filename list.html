<li> Grate your own cheese.</li>
<ul>
<li> Seems to mix better if cheese is freshly grated.</li>
<li> Cheese is moister making for a better bind. </li>
</ul>

<li>Use small measuring cup when rolling balls.</li>
<ul>
<li> This helps keep the size of balls uniform so they will bake evenly.</li>
</ul>
<li> Turn oven to broil during last 2 minutes of baking time. </li>
