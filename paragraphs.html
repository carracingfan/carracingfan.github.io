A Rocky Start
</header>
<article>
<p>
</P>	The day started like any other.  That was true except for the fact that my nerves were on edge in anticipation of my first day of class.  Preparation was underway, I began my checklist:
<ul>
<li>Laptop charged and ready</li>
<li>External microphone working</li>
<li>JAWS & Zoomtext operational</li>
</ul>

<P>	As the time for class to start quickly arrived, I got into place at my desk.  All systems go.  It was time to login to the class.  I clicked the link on the email and entered the Zoom meeting.  “Thank you for your patience,” read JAWS.  Looks like I found the meeting.  As class time grew nearer, I convinced myself that I had done something wrong so I disconnected from the site.  Only 5 minutes to go until the class would start.  I need to be sure I am logging in correctly.  I pressed Enter on the link again!  I heard a lady telling me that the meeting would begin shortly.  What a relief, I made it on time.  

</P>
<P>	I waited to be put into the classroom, ready to get started.  The instructor introduced himself and asked each person in the class to do the same.  Nervously, I told the class about myself and how I came to be in the class.
</P>   	
<P>	
	All was good, or so I thought.  The instructor gave a brief description of the class and then asked if we had WinSCP downloaded.  I promptly told him that I did.  While he was talking with a classmate, I went to the desktop and pressed W.  I heard WORD.  I pressed W again, expecting to hear WinSCP, but got only silence.  Panic set in, I just realized I had WinSCP downloaded alright, but not on the laptop I was using.  It was on my desktop machine, 20 feet across the room.  What was I going to do?
</P>
<P>
	This question was answered a bit later in the class.  The instructor asked if I could take the laptop I was using over to the desktop and access WinSCP.  I told him I could and began tearing down my setup.  The external microphone and headset had to go.  The power to the laptop had to be unplugged.  Battery, don’t fail me now!  I folded the laptop, being careful not to close it completely, and carried it over to the desktop.  I set it on my CCTV table, having to leave it partially closed.  When finally in place at the desktop computer, I announced to my instructor that I was ready.  He graciously talked me through logging on to WinSCP.  It worked perfectly.  I wiped the sweat from my brow and sighed, "it’s working."  Not exactly the way I meant to start my first day in class, but I was in business none the less.

<blockquote>
<P>I should have learned years ago from my scoutmaster, "always be prepared."  After all my planning, it turned out I had forgotten a critical step.  Have everything on the same computer you intend to use for the class.
