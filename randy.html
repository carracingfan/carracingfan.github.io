<h2><p>Randy Sullivan with his Dad, LeRoy Sullivan talks & sings.</p></h2>
<p>Randy would have been only about 2 years old when this recording was made, sometime in the mid 60's.  It was made at his home in Friendship.  His dad can be heard in the background.  It was just before Christmas so they talked about Santa.  </p>
