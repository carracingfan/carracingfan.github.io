<td>Conversations With The enemy</td>
<td>Found in the public library of the town where I grew up.</td>
<td>A Vietnam vet tells of his story as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.  At first he is weak and suffers a lot.  eventuallly, he overcomes the prison
camp and eventually escapes; all by his wits, a little luck, some prayer, his language skills, the ability to eat anything, and his desire to blend in
and survive.</td>

<tr>
<td>A Tale Of Two Cities</td>
<td>First found in my high school 9th or 10th grade class.  It was part of the English literature curriculum</td>
<td>A book about the French revolution and why it was started.  It tells of the story of the fight to survive in the midsts of chaos.  Also, it shows
how we can desire to hurt those who hurt us but in the long run we ar only destroying ourselves.</td>
<tr>
<td>Hackers, Heros of the Computer Revolution by Steven Levy</td> 
<td>Found when I was reading another book about coding.</td>
<td>The story of the original group of hackers over the years.  they hacked the original computers built back in the 30's, 40's, and 50's.  This was
a time when computers were the size of large and eventually small rooms.  The computers also did not have sscreens at first.  It was amazing to see what
these guys could do and how much they were deticated to the idea of programming and hacking.</td>
