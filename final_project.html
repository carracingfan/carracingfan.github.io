<h2>Horton Barker (August 23, 1889 â€“ August 12, 1973)</h2>

<p> 	Horton Barker was an Appalachian
 traditional singer. 
Barker was born in Laurel Bloomery,
Tennessee,
USA. Blind nearly all his life, Barker learned his unusually wide repertoire at the School for the Deaf and Blind in Staunton, Virginia,
as well as at folk festivals in 
Whitetop, Virginia.</p>

<p>	Barker's pure-toned tenor voice earned him a bare living around the region but also brought him to the attention of folklorist 
Alan Lomax,
who recorded Barker in 1937, and later 
Folkways
recording engineer Sandy Paton, who recorded Barker's 1961 LP Horton Barker: Traditional Singer.</p>

<p>	At the age of 75, Barker appeared at the 1965
Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island.
A brief portion of the song "Pretty Sally" from Barker's Saturday performance at that festival is featured in the 1967 documentary film 
Festival,
directed by 
Murray Lerner.</p>

<h2><p>Horton Barker sings a song from his "Traditional Singer"album.</p></h2>
<p>My interest in this pioneer of traditional music is heightened by the fact that Mr. Barker was a resident of my hometown, Chilhowie, Virginia.  He was commonly seen and heard throughout the region singing his Appalachian folk and gospel songs.</p>
<p>My earliest memories of Mr. Barker date back to my elementary school days.  I was captivated by this blind man's talent when Mrs. Pruner, my seventh grade teacher, played Horton Barker's album for the class.</p>

<p>	Horton Barker died in 1973 at the age of 83 in Marion, Virginia.</p>
<p> The Newport Folk Festival is still popular today.  The 1965 festival is historic because it was the first time Bob Dylan had performed using electrical instruments.  Many at the festival were upset, thinking Dylan had abandoned his roots of traditional folk music.</p>
<p> Long before the Newport festival came into existence, music history was being made in a small town on the border of Tennessee and Virginia.  The 1927 Bristol Sessions  are considered to be a pivotal event contributing to the birth of Country Music.  </p>
