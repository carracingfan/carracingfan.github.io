<h2><p>Poppy Sparks along with Thenia Waddel, his daughter, talk to Ernest</p></h2>
<p>My This recording was made at Aunt Thenia's house on Dry Fork in the mid 60's.  They discussed a fishing trip that Poppy and my grandfather, John Sparks, took sometime between 1955 & 1958.  They had journeyed to Chilhowie and fished with my Dad, Ernest, and my grandfather, Scott Heath. </p>
