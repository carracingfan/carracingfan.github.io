<h2><p>Barbara tells a joke</p></h2>
<p>The kids were all willing to be recorded on the new recorder.  This was recorded at Barbara's house in Friendship.  It was her turn to talk into the microphone.  Several of us kids were sitting around the machine, eager to talk.  Barbara was around 10 years old.   </p>
